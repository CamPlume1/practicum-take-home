# Khoury Industry Partner Co-op: Software Development Takehome
This takehome is designed to assess your skills as a full stack software developer. This take home will expect knowledge of technologies you are unlikely to have learned in your courses. Feel free to take advantage of whatever resources you usually use to develop. That being said, you should be prepared to discuss all of the changes you made, and the thought process behind them during an interview.

There is no time limit on this challenge, but it is designed to take between 60 and 90 minutes.

## Development Environment Prerequisites
Before starting this challenge, ensure you have installed the latest versions of nodeJS and python.

## Figma
This challenge will ask you to reference wireframes that can be found in [this Figma board](https://www.figma.com/design/1GfVyS6MgGZxWB64KSPRag/Untitled?node-id=0-1&t=0epGWkgxWP20bc2g-1)
