# Task 2
We are designing a new course selection service. Right now we are displaying a single card. You are tasked with adding two key peices of functionality, as shown on the Figma board:

**Support Multiple Courses:** Render all of the provided courses as shown in the figma, rather than just the first

**Selection:** Users should be able to select a course by clicking the "Select" button. This should make the selected course have a highlighted border! Clicking the button again should un-highlight it. Multiple courses may be highlighted at once

## Running the app
