# Task 3
We are designing a new bank account page for a client in the financial services industry. The frontend team has already created a low-fi implementation, which uses mock data. Please update their implementation to use real data coming from the backend!!

**The name, balance, and total pending charges of the user should all use live data**

Do **NOT** change the response schema of the backend.


## Running the backend
Run the following commands to run the backend.

```
cd backend
pip install flask
pip install flask-cors
python app.py
```

## Running the frontend

**Note:** You should run the frontend and backend in different terminals

```
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```



## Hints
Checkout the backend implementation to see what endpoints are available to you. Note the schema, and how it may differ from the mock data you've been given
